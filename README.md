# Will-A.I-TakeOver-Humans-
I made a webpage called "Will A.I TakeOver Humans[Source Code].html" to explore if Artificial Intelligence (AI) could replace humans. The page covers AI's history since 1956 and its use in healthcare, self-driving cars, finance, and smart assistants. It shows how AI can improve work in some areas but has limits compared to humans, like in medical diagnosis. You can download or view the code to learn more about AI's role with humans in different jobs.
